Python For Colab:
Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education.


Fundamentals oF AI ML:


Training Phase
test phase
Deploymnt Phase 



How ML Algorithm Works?
NLP= Generative AI like CHatgpt
How Machines Learn from the data?
data always may not be clean
Data Sample should Represent all the Logics

Good data = accuracy


AI RObotics
ML= Algorithm try to learn pattern, Deep Learning= Neural Network, 

Data Science, Data mining
ABout Extracting and work with data to take out insight.
EDA , Statistics

Program:
Data; program; output

ML:
Data ;Output ;program

Ethical AI

Rule Based 
 for Very less data

Prediction: 

ML:
Learn a Function from data Using ML Algorithm 

Training Data; ML Algorithms; "Models"

Taxonomy (Types)of ML
Unsupervised
Supervised
Reinforcement


Supervised:
with labelled data(data that has been assigned a label or category or Meaning)

Image classification
Regression


Unsupervised:
Find Pattern without Predefined Outputs
Data; Algorithm; output

They Use Identity Matrix (Similarity or dissimilarity)

Clustering; PCA( Remove irrelevant data i.e. do Data Compression); 

1. Crop Disease Detection Using ML
2. Weed Detection 
3. Stock Price Prediction
4. Car sales Price Prediction
5. Sentiment Analysis Nepali Text


Steps in Supervised Learning:
Data Collection and Preparation
	Kaggle/dataset
	Uci
	Google Dataset

Choosing ML Model
Train
Evaluate
Parameter Tuning 
prediction testing


# Regression  (Continuos)
# Classification (Categorical)


Training Model Issue:
Overfitting & Underfitting  
Bias & Variance Tradeoff


# valuation Metrices
